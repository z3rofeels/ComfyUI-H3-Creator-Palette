"""The MiniMax H3 PreStage node: stills for the pipeline, made on the left.

The Creator consumes images — a start frame, an end frame, references, style
sheets — and until this node existed it had no way to make one. The PreStage
generates them locally with Krea 2, Ideogram 4.0 (both open weights, both native
in core) or MiniMax H3 itself, and saves them where the picker already looks, so
a finished still is one chip away from being the next render's keyframe.

The third of those is a different animal and lives in `compile_still.py` /
`render_still.py`: H3 is a video model, so a still from it is a video generation
whose first latent frame is decoded as a picture, through an experimental T=1
image VAE. It reuses the video pipeline outright — the same segment node, the
same checkpoints, the same canvas — which is the point of having it: no second
model family loaded, and a keyframe made by the weights that will render the
shot it opens.

It is built exactly like the Creator, because it is driven exactly like the
Creator: zero sockets, one JSON blob the UI owns, weights named by filename,
and an expanded subgraph that loads, samples, decodes and saves — see
`creator_node.py`'s docstring for why a node that samples cannot be an ordinary
node. The one difference is social rather than structural: a PreStage is a
property of the shot being set up, not a node the user hunts the menu for, so
the frontend spawns and removes it from a pill on the Creator/Timeline body
(`js/minimax_creator/prestage.js`) rather than expecting it to be placed by
hand. It still *is* an ordinary node underneath — placeable, copyable,
saveable — because anything else would fight LiteGraph for no benefit.

Queueing both nodes at once is deliberately not an ordering: the hand-off is by
file, so there is no execution edge to get wrong, and ComfyUI's input-hash
caching makes an untouched PreStage a cache hit on the queue that renders the
video.
